# X-Emulators

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/lgblgblgb/xemu.svg)](https://gitter.im/lgblgblgb/xemu?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

Emulations running on Linux/Unix/Windows/OSX of various (mainly 8 bit) machines,
including the Commodore LCD and Commodore 65 (with some Mega65 hacks) as well.

WARNING: there is *nothing* too much common in these machines. The only reason
that I emulate these within a single project, that I can easily re-use some
of the components needed, that's all!

This file is only some place holder here :) For some sane documentation, please
