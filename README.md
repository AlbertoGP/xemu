Note: there is *nothing* too much common in these machines. The only reason
that I emulate these within a single project, that I can easily re-use some
of the components needed, that's all! Also, the list of emulated machines is
simply the preference of myself, what I would like to emulate, nothing special
about the selections.

This file is only some place holder :) For some sane documentation, please **visit

If you - for some reason - need the old, and possible **highly outdated** README.md,
you can find it, by browsing older git revisions, or here, in the wiki section:
