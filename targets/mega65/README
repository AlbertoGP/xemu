This is about Mega65, to learn more, visit this site: http://mega65.org/

Mega65 target is a slightly modified Commodore 65 emulation. WARNING: This is
NOT a full Mega65 emulation but only the minimal feature sub-set of Mega65
which is enough for some purproses, like Kickstart ROM development and
debugging. Do NOT expect that it runs Mega65 specific software in general!

Mega65 mode is *only* used if the emulator can load KICKUP.M65 (case sensitive
name ... at least on UNIX like machines). You should have one, placed into
the rom/ directory for example (or the current directory, xemu tries different
places, see emu_load_file() function in common/emutools.c about this). Without
KICKUP.M65 the machine boots and functions like a C65, even C65GS I/O keying
won't be supported (however this mode is not tested too much, for this, please
use the c65 target instead of this one).

You must also provide an image file of the SD-card for the Mega65. The file
name should be mega65.img with the same rules of placement as with KICKUP.M65
for sure. This is a simple image file, really. On UNIX-like system, you can
even try to symlink the device node of a real SD-card reader, but be careful
with the access rights, so Xemu can open it at all. Without this image
Kickstart won't be able to use the emulated SD-card controller normally,
of course.


== NOTES ==


Basically the same as my Commodore 65 emulator, however:

* $D02F keying support for Mega65 mode
* Some Mega65 specific I/O support
* Hypervisor MAP mode, limited load/save machine state (not all stuffs!)
* NOTE: currently, >1MByte MAP/linear access/etc is *NOT* supported at all
  (other than the special case of Hypervisor memory mapping $8000-$BFFF and
  the DMA hack, so Kickstart can use DMA)
* Loading KICKUP.M65 by the emulator (if it does not work, "simple C65 mode"
  will be used, without any Mega65 feature)
* Super-ugly 16 bit text mode support to be able to see "something", currently
  only with incrementing video/colour pointers by two, but no extra data is
  interpreted at all.
* Mega65 SD-card support (still doesn't work) only with the absolute needed
  features


== HIGH PRIORITY TODO ==


* SD card controller does not work, kickstart reads sector 0 some times
  but nothing happens
* There is no write support for SD-card at all
* More VIC-IV features, starting with acceptable 16 bit text support
* True Mega65 favour of MAP opcode support with offsets up to 28 bits
* 28 bit load support for ZP Z indexed special opcode
* 28 bit JMP/etc support?
* Backtrace support in case of hypervisor out-of-bound code execution?
