This is a work-in-progress, for internal use TODO file only!

TODO list for Mega-65 shorter term (m65mem branch lifetime):

* Write new memory handling [DONE]
* Again: try different solutions for best performance within similar constraints? [PENDING]
* Make new memory handling work ... [DONE?]
* ... test it!
* Try to in-line CPU read/write primitives, check the performance impact
* Rewrite I/O decoder ...
* ... test it!
* Hook DMA for (the new) direct internal I/O decoder [DONE?]
* CPU optimization idea: paged read/write primitives
* RMW CPU primitive optimization
* Move VIC mode change into a handler in vic stuff
* Make snapshotting working again
* Make (uart-)mon working again
* Fix uart-mon with breakpoint (didn't worked even in master branch since the multi-op CPU performance patch)
* Test if uart-mon works at all in a sane way ...
* Better speed control, allow custom M65-fast mode, just for test (CLI-switch?) [DONE]
* Maybe: rationalize the place of functions/variables within sources, maybe rename some sources
* Check header includes, a mess now :( Kill ones not needed in a given source (see the previous point too)
* Clean-up ...
* Extensive testing!!
* Merge m65mem into master, delete m65mem branch
* Binary deployment

SMALLER [?] misc TODOs in the future:

* Allow kbd scanning work in the oppsite way too (C65 material too)
* Import some C65 cnanges, OSD tries, and C1531 mouse emulation
* SD-card: emulate some delay after operation: it causes too much load on the host box being "zero time ready" condition
* M65 similar FDC r/w control "LED" on the screen corner?

Some theory should be checked:

* Colour related VIC reg: only lower 4 bits in C65 mode? (C65 material too)
* CPU I/O port "unused bits" on C65/M65: are the values readable back? (C65 material too)
* VIC-III ROM mappings cannot be "written-through" as C65 ROM mappings? (C65 material too)
* Extended colour RAM (C65 too!) and SD-card buffer mapping remains if mode switched back to VIC-II?
* Extended colour related VIC-regs remains if switched back VIC mode?
