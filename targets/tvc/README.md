# Videoton TV Computer ("tvc")

Videoton TV Computer is a Z80 based, 8 bit computer. The emulation is extremly
primitve, lacking for example:

* Sound
* Exact timing
* Most of the interrupt generation possibilities ...
* No CRTC emulation at all, blindly do just the defaults always ...
* No storage support (disk, tape, whatever ...)
* Only model 64+ is tried to be emulated
* No video RAM "clock stretching" is emulated
* No cards and associated features (memory and I/O regions, etc) are emulated
* Keyboard mapping is lame and not complete

Etc, you can find some more :) Basically now it's enough to "turn it on" see the
logo and try to type something in BASIC, that's all :-)
